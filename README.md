## 📄 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)** design for a boutique bakery. The goal was to translate a brand identity into a responsive, high-fidelity web interface that drives customer conversion.

## 🧠 Design Thinking
* **Visual Identity:** Utilized a "stripes and sweets" motif with high-contrast pinks and pastels to evoke a playful, appetizing atmosphere.
* **User Flow:** Streamlined the path from "Landing" to "Menu" to ensure customers can view products within one click.
* **Layout:** Designed a grid-based gallery for the "Sweet Treats" section to maximize visual appeal without clutter.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Figma:** Used for wireframing, high-fidelity vector design, and interactive prototyping.
* **Adobe Illustrator:** Used for custom asset creation.
